## Fun followups

### Folder deletion

Make sure you fetch all of the folder that have it as a parent and their children too

### Folder creations

Make a server action that takes a name and parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (don't forget to set the ownerId).

### Access control

Check if user is owner before showing the folder page.

### File view

Make a "file view" page

You get the idea. Maybe check out my last tutorial?

### Toasts!

Gray out a row while it's being deleted
